<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the <em>b</em>o<em>r</em>o<em>g</em>o<em>v</em>e<em>s</em>,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<h2>'Beware the Jabberwock, my son!</h2>
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
<h3>The frumious Bandersnatch!'</h3>
<section id="background1">
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood a while in thought.
<section id="jabberwock">
And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</section>

<ol><li>One two!</li> <li>One two!</li> And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.</ol></section>

'And hast thou slain the <a href="http://www.jbwkz.com/mgm/">Jabberwock</a>?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
Oh frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.

<section id="background2">'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

<h4>The Walrus and the Carpenter</h4>
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright --</section>
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
<section id="background3">
<h5>The moon</h5> was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done --
'It's very rude of him.' she said,
'To come and spoil the fun!'

The sea was wet as wet could be,
<header>The sands were dry as dry.
You could not see a cloud, because
</header>No <header>cloud was in the sky:
No birds were flying overhead --
There were no birds to</header> fly.</section>

<section id="Walrus">The Walrus and the Carpenter
Were walking close at hand:
They wept like anything to see
Such quantities of sand:
'If this were only cleared away,'
They said, 'it would be grand.'</section>

<ul><li>'If seven maids</li> with seven mops
Swept it for half a year,
<li>Do you suppose,'</li> the Walrus said,</ul>
<section id="Walrus2">'That they could get it clear?'
'l doubt it,' said the Carpenter,
And shed a bitter tear.</section>

<section id="oysters">'O Oysters,</section> come and walk with us!
The Walrus did beseech.
'A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk,
<section id="background4">Along the briny beach:
We cannot do with more than four,
To give a hand to each.'

The eldest Oyster looked at him,
But never a word he said:
The eldest Oyster winked his eye,
And shook his heavy head --</section>
Meaning to say he did not choose
To leave the oyster-bed.
<section id="div1">
Out four young Oysters hurried up.
All eager for the treat:
Their coats were brushed, their faces washed,
Their shoes were clean and neat --
And this was odd, because, you know,
They hadn't any feet.</section>

<section id="div2"><s>Four other Oysters followed them,</s>
And yet another four;
And thick and fast they came at last,
And more, and more, and more --
All hopping through the frothy waves,
And scrambling to the shore.</section>
<section id="div3">
The Walrus and the Carpenter
Walked on a mile or so,
And then they rested on a rock
Conveniently low:
And all the little Oysters stood
And waited in a row.</section>
<section id="divy"> </section>
'The time has come,' the Walrus said,
<h6>'To talk of many things:
Of shoes -- and ships -- and sealing wax --
Of cabbages -- and kings --</h6>
And why the sea is boiling hot --
And whether pigs have wings.'
<section id="div4">
'But wait a bit,' the Oysters cried,
'Before we have our chat;
For some of us are out of breath,
And all of us are fat!'
'No hurry!' said the Carpenter.
They thanked him much for that.</section>
<section id="space">
'A loaf of bread,' the Walrus said,
'Is what we chiefly need:
Pepper and vinegar besides
Are very good indeed --
Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear,
We can begin to feed.'</section>
<section id="test2">
'But not on us!' the Oysters cried,
Turning a little blue.
'After such kindness, that would be
A dismal thing to do!'
'The night is fine,' the Walrus said,
'Do you admire the view?'

'It was so kind of you to come!</section>
<strong>A</strong><section id="test3">nd you are very nice!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'Cut us another slice-
I wish <footer>you were not quite so deaf-
I've had to ask yo</footer>u twi</section>ce!'

<p>'It </p>seems<p> a </p>shame,<p>' the </p>Walrus<p> said,</p>
'<section id="test4">To play them such a trick.
After we've brought them out so far,
And made them trot so quick!'
The Carpenter said nothing but
'The butter's spread too thick!'

'I weep for you,'the Walrus said:
'I deeply sym</section>pathize.'
With sobs and tears he sorted out
<section id="background5">Those of the largest size,
<footer>Holding his pocket-handkerchief
Before his streaming eyes.</footer>

'O Oysters,' said the Carpenter,
'You've had a pleasant run!
Shall we be trotting home again?'
But answer came there none --
And this was scarcely odd, because</section>
They'd eaten every one.
